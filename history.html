            <h1>History of BUCC</h1>
            <p>
                Some notes from ex-members.
            </p>
            <h2>Ian Dixson (BUCC ’81-’82)</h2>
            <p>
                Now you're asking! I started caving whilst at Derby (what was Derby Lonsdale College) during my initial degree years from 78
                to 81. We had a walking weekend in the Mendips, someone dropped out of the parallel caving group so I gave it a go, got
                hooked and then spent many weekends underground. On moving to Bangor, for my PGCE, there was no CC so set about
                setting up a new one via the Athletic Union. I honestly can't remember my title....Chair, maybe? Possibly President. There was
                enough interest during Freshers to form a club aided by a friend from Derby days. We used to run trips to S Wales, Derbyshire,
                Yorkshire and, during a very cold winter of 81/82, to Ireland. I managed to obtain a very generous Union grant of about £600 to
                purchase all manner of kit..add a nought on the end for inflation. We must have held formal meetings/had a constitution of
                some sort/made financial reports but all that is well in the past. The CC carried on for several years after I left. Unfortunately,
                there was one death I've heard about since...another Ian who tried to free climb a waterfall, fell, was knocked unconscious and
                drowned. I'm guessing the CC lost members and/or was closed after that. The kit was kept at St Mary's in a kind of undercroft.
                So, you're best bet might be to go through the Athletic Union as they should have exemplar constitutions. Nowadays,
                organising caving trips may well come with a lot more in the way of risk assessment/liability insurance and paperwork. We used
                to get in a minibus, stay at SWCC or a caravan at Ingleton (80p a night each!) and get on with it sometimes having three
                groups underground in different caves at any one time. I subsequently spent most of my working life teaching geography and
                organising all manner of school trips in UK and beyond.
            </p>
            <h2>Chris Cowdery (BUCC ’93-’96)</h2>
            <p>
                BUCC had a Captain during my time there (which was &#39;93 to &#39;96).
                I am still in touch with a few people from BUCC, and we have an annual
                caving trip most years.
                Other random thoughts are:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We used to do a trip to Poachers (Ogof Hen Ffynhonnau) during
                        Freshers Week.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We used to meet every other Monday (I think, it might have been every
                        Monday) at the Friddoed Bar
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We used to stay at peoples houses as well as Caving Club huts. We had
                        somebody in Bridgend, Keighley, Trowbridge.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We&#39;d do mines as well, which is handy in North Wales!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We visited Box Mine and camped underground, and did the same in
                        Rhosydd Slate Quarry.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We issued membership cards. I have attached one for reference. The
                        creature was drawn by Graham Tattersall, and was called Stig. We had a
                        colour scheme too, magenta, cyan and yellow, for membership classes
                        (commitee, normal and honourary), but I forget which colour was which.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We used to publish a membership list (probably illegal now), which
                        shows Captain, Treasurer, Secretary, Gear Warden, Safety Officer, Social
                        Secretary and Driver. It also listed the normal members.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We had a number of sets of SRT gear. I remember getting a grant and
                        buying them. I think they went to the AU when the club folded.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I know two people who stayed on for post-graduate studies (one to do
                        a PhD), so at least one of them was in BUCC to the turn of the millennium.
                    </li>
                </ol>
